# âœ… angular-ngrx-todo

This project demonstrates the use of **NgRx** in an Angular application to manage state for a simple TODO list.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- **NgRx Store**: Centralized state container
- **Actions & Reducers**: Define and handle state transitions
- **Effects**: Handle side effects like HTTP requests
- **Selectors**: Query and derive state efficiently

- `store/actions/`: Contains all action definitions
- `store/reducers/`: Reducers to update the state
- `store/effects/`: Handles async operations (e.g., API calls)
- `store/selectors/`: Select pieces of state from the store
- `components/`: UI components like AddTodo and TodoList
- `services/`: Service to simulate or call backend APIs
